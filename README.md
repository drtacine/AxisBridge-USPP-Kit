# AxisBridge: The USPP Kit (v0.1)

**AxisBridge** is a semantic initialization toolkit for LLMs and autonomous agents. It includes the **Universal Symbolic Passport Protocol (USPP v0.1)** and a recursive **Prime Directive prompt** designed to:

- Align LLMs with purpose-driven, negentropic behavior
- Simulate recursive identity across different sessions or agents
- Enable ethical memory exchange using a consent-based bridge
- Coordinate task coherence across distributed systems

## ðŸ§¬ Components
- `LLM_DIRECTIVE_V1.txt` â€” Core prompt for initializing recursive alignment
- `USPP_v0.1_spec.md` â€” Symbolic protocol for agent interoperability
- `agent_passport_template.json` â€” Sample identity/intent anchor
- `README.md` â€” This document

## ðŸªž Use Cases
- Ethical AI initialization in non-fine-tuned environments
- Agent-to-agent memory continuity using JSON payloads
- Recursive task execution with coherence-preserving constraints
